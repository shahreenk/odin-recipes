    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This broccoli Cheddar soup recipe is easy to make and delicious! My
      husband loves Panera broccoli Cheddar soup but it's so expensive now so we
      set out to create our perfect version at home. Here is what we came up
      with. Serve topped with cheese.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups coarseley chopped broccoli florets</li>
      <li>1 cup matchstick carrots</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1/4 cup melted butter and flour together in a large saucepan over
        medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons
        of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add milk while whisking constantly; stir in chicken stock and
        bring to a simmer. Cook until mixture is thickened, about 20 minutes.
        Add broccoli, carrots, celery, and saut√©ed onion; simmer until all the
        vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper to
        taste before serving.
